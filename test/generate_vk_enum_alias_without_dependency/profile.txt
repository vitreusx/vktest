# This has aliases to IMG_filter_cubic, but it's not listed as a dependency
# (it was, but only until 1.2.147, see
# https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/commit/3c1ca55f2e0b4b9423cf9c0b30400b1a4d61c5d1
# ). The resulting file should thus have just the EXT values, not IMG. See the
# generate_vk_enum_alias_with_dependency for a test of the true dependency
# behavior.
